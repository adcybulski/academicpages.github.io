## What is a Capture the Flag Competition?
Capture the flag (CTF) is a competitive game in which players mimic the experience of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in information systems, hacking into simulated software and/or networks to retrieve data known as a ‘flag.’ CTF participants, often drawn from the information security and IT industries utilize these games as a means of training to develop/apply offensive security knowledge in a legal way, so that they can better defend the software/systems they are entrusted with. Lily Irani has described similar kinds of participation as the “entrepreneurial citizenship” of present-day high-tech labour (Irani, 2015, p.801), the activities that workers perform extrinsic to their workplace to make themselves more desirable/productive employees. 

## About the Project:



## Methods: 
This research project utilizes three methods or stages for data collection. The first will be semi-structured interviews with CTF designers (roughly 10-20 designers). The second will be participant observation of 4-5 teams of CTF competitors (or about 12-50 players) as they compete or qualify for a CTF during or prior to a hacker convention. The third will be follow-up interviews with competitors immediately following (or soon after) the CTF event. Since a majority of CTF competitions are undertaken by teams at conventions, it makes sense to study this cluster of participants as a unit while they compete in the context of the convention to understand the procedural and environmental factors that contribute to CTF play. As Pink et al. observe, studying events allows ethnographers begin “re-theorizing” the impact of digital media on “production, consumption and dissemination… temporally and spatially through the processual theory of place-as-event” (Pink et al., p.184, 2016). Establishing the context and procedure of CTF play as it is supported through and occurs within digital technologies is important as scholars of ethnography have increasingly argued that “interviews are unlikely to be productive by themselves”, and that “multiple methods should be used in any investigation” where ethnographic research is applied (Walford, p.118, 2009).
