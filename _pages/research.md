## Research Participants

If you're reading this page, it is likely that I've reached out to you to request your participation in my doctoral research project. Thank you for your consideration.

## Informed Consent Documents:
If you are considering participating in my doctoral research you will need to fill out an informed consent request document and return it to me. You may do so electronically via e-mail or by printing and signing the document.

Providing verbal consent to act as a research participant is possible, should you have material concerns about signing the consent documents. Please note: should you wish to provide verbal consent you do not need to state your rationale to the researcher. 

[The informed consent document is available for download here.](https://adcybulski.com/files/informedconsent.pdf)

## Further Questions:
Further questions about your rights as a participant in the study can be directed to the University of Toronto Office of Research Ethics by phone (416) 946-3273 or by email at ethics.review@utoronto.ca. You can also contact my supervisor, Dr. Sara Grimes by e-mail at sara.grimes@utoronto.ca.
