I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Information, where I study sociotechnical approaches to cybersecurity. In particuar I am interested in how hackers have developed expertise, technology and strategies for creating computer insecurity in the service of security. I am currently in the midst of writing my doctoral dissertation on games played by hackers in the information security community, commonly known at Capture the Flag competitions, or CTFs.
