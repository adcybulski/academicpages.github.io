What is a MITACS Accelerate Internship?
======
MITACS accelerate is an internship where a graduate student, their supervisor and an organization (you) partner to identify a resesarch project.

the scholarship org (MITACS) matches the salary of a researcher up to $7,500 (though that is the ceiling), so the graduate student receives up to $15,000 in funding. The organization can be a private institution or a not-for-profit.

What would your organization get out of this?
---
A highly qualified intern for 4 months of work which is equally subsidized by MITACS. 

Ideally a great partner for this would be an org looking to do research into their workforce, clients or users; related to security training and education. Though any kind of human-centric research would be a good fit. I've got a background in security awareness programs and training & good references. I know a lot of orgs run security awareness via PTE - so if you wanted to pick up someone on subsidized hours - it would be a great opportunity.

What do I (Alex) get out of it?
---
The funding for this would help me pay to wrap up graduate school and the experience would awesome. Perhaps more importantly for a PhD a MITACS partnership is a really powerful thing to have on an academic CV.
