This thesis, a platform study of Microsoft's videogame console the Xbox 360, demonstrates how one of the defining traits of the videogame platform's design and architecture is pervasive surveillance of its users. By applying William Bogard's (1996) theory of surveillant "enclosures," this thesis will explain how the Xbox 360 uses a panopoly of methods and technologies to watch users and shape their use of the videogame system, forming them as easily governed subjects. In support of this argument, this thesis will examine not only the hardware and software layers of the Xbox 360, but also peripheral hardware and networks including the motion tracking sensor the Kinect and Xbox Live, the videogame console's online network. Of particular interest to this platform study will be an examination of how each of these layers performs surveillance, and how they collectively perform a project of governance over videogame players.<br> <br>References Bogard, William.
